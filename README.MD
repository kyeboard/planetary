# [Planetary](https://planetary.kyeboard.me)

Get ready to slay your to-do list like a dragon-slaying knight with this app. It's like a personal assistant without the coffee addiction and annoying small talk. Say 'goodbye' to procrastination and 'hello' to getting sh*t done. Don't be a potato on the couch, be a productive potato with this app.

## Participants
I worked solo on this project and killed it, but I'm pretty sure I also killed a few brain cells in the process.
